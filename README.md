This project is a website that uses React.js, Express.js, and MongoDB to make a sort of archive for recipes where a user can login, register, and logout to add their recipes with various ingredients and measurements. Users can also delete and edit their own recipes. Each user also has their own "My Recipes" page with just their own recipes, which disappears if theres no user logged in.
